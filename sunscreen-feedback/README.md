Sunscreen that warns the wearer
=====================

Add a chemical to sunscreen that causes it to change color or emit a smell when it is becoming ineffective.

* Sweat mixed with sunscreen can reduce effectiveness, so perhaps a chemical reaction with the salt in
sweat could be used to drive the sunscreen change. Problematic if the wearer swims in seawater, so maybe salt *and*
protein are necessary.

* Not sure how to detect thinning of a sunscreen layer.

Variants:

* Sunscreen warns instead by heating up.  It should obviously not cause a thermal burn, but this may actually be the 
best way to warn the wearer since it does not involve a volitional step to look at the sunscreen or a transient smell
which wind could waft away or to which the wearer could habituate.

* Sunscreen converts the heat of the sun's rays to a cooling effect.  (Alcohols do this -- evaporation causes cooling.
Would have to find something more long-lasting.). But this might enable the wearer to stay in the sun longer!
