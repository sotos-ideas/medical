Estimate population prevalence of mental illness in past eras
===================================

It is easy to forget that certain chronic diseases affecting the brain were common in the past.  

It would be interesting, therefore, to sum the prevalance estimates for these diseases, with the goal of estimating how many people walking around central Europe in 1300 (or whatever) were mentally deranged.  Surely it must be orders of magnitude more common than now.  What effect would that have had on society?

As one tangible societal effect, James R. Flynn found that scores on IQ tests performed on US military recruits in the 20th century rose about 3 points per decade (McHugh and Slavney, The Perspectives of Psychiatry, 2nd ed., p105, citing Psychological Bulletin 1984; 95: 29-51).

With infectious and nutritional diseases leading the way, example diseases to consider include:

- Infectious
  - syphilis
  - parasites
  - chronic meningitis (e.g. tuberculosis)
  - acute meningitis sequelae
  - post-viral encephalopathies
  - post-febrile encephalopathies
- Nutritional
  - childhood malnutrition impacting brain development
  - vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency (including Wernicke-Korsakoff)
  - vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency (including pellagra)
  - vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency (including pernicious anemia)
  - folate deficiency (neurological effects are controversial)
- Intoxications
  - alcohol
- uremic encephalopathy
- post-traumatic brain conditions
- birth-related brain damage

As just one example, immediately before penicillin appeared in the mid-1940s, one out of every 42 persons in the United States had syphilis, and in some large populations the figure was one in eight!  (Stokes, Modern Clinical Syphilology, 3rd ed., 1944,  page 1185)  Of course, there was little or no syphilis in 1300, but there was a lot more malnutrition.

If life in the past was indeed nasty, brutish, and short, then the fraction of people walking around with unscathed brains must have been far smaller than today.
